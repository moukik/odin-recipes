This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), where I'm building a basic recipe website using only HTML. The goal is to reinforce foundational web development skills like writing semantic HTML, structuring content properly, and understanding how websites are built from scratch.

Even though my main motivation lies in penetration testing and bug bounty hunting, I believe having a strong grasp of how websites are built is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities more effectively. By completing this project, Iâ€™ll demonstrate an understanding of core HTML concepts, and lay the groundwork for learning more advanced topics like JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and eventually secure coding practices. This marks the beginning of my full-stack journey from a security mindset.
